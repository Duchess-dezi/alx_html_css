              <h1>What is Risk?</h1>
               <p>In simple terms, risk is the possibility of something bad happening. Risk involves uncertainty about the effects/implications of an activity with respect to something that humans value (such as health, well-being, wealth, property or the environment), often focusing on negative, undesirable consequences. Many different definitions have been proposed. One international standard definition of risk is the "effect of uncertainty on objectives".</p>
               <p>The understanding of risk, the methods of assessment and management, the descriptions of risk and even the definitions of risk differ in different practice areas (business, economics, environment, finance, information technology, health, insurance, safety, security etc). This article provides links to more detailed articles on these areas. The international standard for risk management, ISO 31000, provides principles and general guidelines on managing risks faced by organizations.</p>
              <h2>What is Risk Taking?</h2>
                <p>Risk-taking is the act of doing something that could be dangerous or risky in order to achieve a goal. It can be a conscious or non-conscious behavior, and it involves uncertainty about the outcome, costs, or benefits. 
Risk-taking can be an important part of entrepreneurship and business. It can also be a part of learning, such as when a student tries a new note-taking method or takes on a leadership role in a group project. 
However, risk-taking can become a problem when it's done without considering the consequences, which could include serious injury or death. Some examples of negative risk-taking behaviors include: Experimenting with alcohol or drugs, Having unprotected sex, Skipping school, Getting a ride from someone who has been drinking, and Shoplifting or vandalism.</p>
             <h3>Types of Risk Taking</h3>
               <p>We observed three types of risk-takers: conservative, calculated, and impulsive. Impulsives were less accurate and planful under stress, calculated risk-takers took fewer risks, and conservatives engaged in low risk-taking regardless of stress.</p>
